## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- Redis (for caching and session management)
- AWS S3 account (for secure design file storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/islem-zaraa/B2B-Print-On-Demand.git
   cd B2B-Print-On-Demand
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your configuration details.

4. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Architecture

The platform is built with a microservices architecture:

- **Frontend**: React.js with Material UI and Content Security Policy
- **Backend API**: Node.js with Express and robust security middleware
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- **Design Service**: Handles design uploads and processing with malware scanning
- **Order Management Service**: Processes and tracks orders
- **Fulfillment Service**: Connects with print providers
- **Analytics Service**: Generates reports and insights
- **Security Service**: Handles threat detection and mitigation

## Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Configuration**: All secrets and credentials are stored in environment variables, never in code
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks
3. **Output Encoding**: Data is properly encoded before rendering to prevent XSS
4. **HTTPS Only**: All communications are encrypted with TLS/SSL
5. **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP implementation to prevent XSS attacks
6. **Security Headers**: Implementation of recommended security headers
7. **Regular Dependency Updates**: Automated dependency scanning and updates
8. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DDoS attacks
9. **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection against cross-site request forgery
10. **Session Management**: Secure cookie settings and session timeout
